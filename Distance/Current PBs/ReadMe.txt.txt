This ReadMe is a little reminder of how folders work:
- You're currently in a 'Current PBs' folder, so please check the player and put the new media in its folder
- You should keep Former PBs in the folder anyway if the new media is an improvement of an already existing PB in the folder
- If the Player changed its name, please rename the folder (renaming the media aren't necessary)
- Please respect the notation as the following: YYYY-MM-DD_Level_Player_Score_Platform.png Example: 2013-08-27_LandsDistance_RaymanPlayer_32.76km_WiiU.png
